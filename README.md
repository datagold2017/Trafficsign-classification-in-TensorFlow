# Practical introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow

Hi guys! My name Robert Maier. I'm currently a student at OTH Regensburg. Due to a 2 months project work I had my first hands on experience with python, TensorFlow and convolutional neural networks. This notebook and the code that goes with it are the results of that work. This Notebook is supposed to help sutdents getting started with TensorFlow and give some insights into CNNs.

## What are we going to do?
<> Build a CNN for traffic sign classification with ~ 99.1 % accuracy based on the GTSRB
<> Use TensorFlow and Python to do all the work
<> Get a feeling on how CNNs work
<> What to keep in mind when working with a CNN

## Requirements
<> TensorFlow with GPU support (and a supported GPU!)
<> 16 GB RAM (since we will do all the stuff quick and dirty ;)
<> skimage and OpenCV for python 3.5.x

### Note
The .ipynb-notebook has some images included which sum up to ~7MB
